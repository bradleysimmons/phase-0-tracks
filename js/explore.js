// In comments, pseudocode a function that takes a string 
// as a parameter and reverses the string. reverse("hello"), 
// for example, should return "olleh". This isn't a task 
// specific to JavaScript -- your pseudocode should be in 
// plain English and use phrases like "for each" instead 
// of JavaScript-specific terms. Remember that you can add 
// strings in JavaScript, so '' + 'a' would result in the 
// string 'a'. Take your time. This is the most valuable 
// skill in programming: being able to think through a 
// problem logically.


// find last character and add to new string
// find second to last character and add to string
// build a loop that increments this 
// and adds to new string until
// new string and input string length are equal

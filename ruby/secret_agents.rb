#A decrypt method that reverses the process above. 
#Note that Ruby doesn't have a built-in method for 
#going backward one letter. How can you find out 
#where a letter is in the alphabet, then access

#session above, you learned how to ask a string 
#for the index of a letter. "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" 
#counts as a string.

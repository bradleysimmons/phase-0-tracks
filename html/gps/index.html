        <p>html 5 semantic tags help to group elements.  they are especially useful for providing context to screen readers and developers reading through the code.  i think the nav is the most specific semantic tag, which makes it the most useful.  they all have a specific context though, so it is hard to decide.</p>
        <p>i am having trouble understanding the order the browser uses to display elements.  it seems that it depends on the browser and how the parser is set up.  it seems some parse top to bottom, some bottom to top, and some are customized completely differently.</p>
        <p>i loved learning how to create a snippet in sublime.  i am practicing hot keys and shortcuts and efficiency.  davina, my guide, taught me at least five things in this area that were extremely helpful.  i'm going to keep working on it.</p>
        <p>i think i had the most trouble setting up my github properly so i could provide a link.  it was the first time i created a new directory to add to a github repository.  i just need to practice these things.  i'm really thankful for the guided session because i got a lot of help clarifying ideas that i was understanding only a little bit.</p>
        <p>i do not need accessibility features at the moment and i am also not a web developer.  i found that i had to consider these perspectives more to understand semantic elements more clearly.  my guide came through with some great explanations as well.</p>
